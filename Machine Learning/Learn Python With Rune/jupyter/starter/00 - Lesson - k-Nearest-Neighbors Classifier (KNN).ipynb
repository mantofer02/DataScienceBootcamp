    "- **Train model**: This is where the magic happens, the learning step (Train model). There are three main paradigms in machine learning.\n",
    "    - **Supervised**: where you tell the algorithm what categories each data item is in. Each data item from the training set is tagged with the right answer.\n",
    "    - **Unsupervised**: is when the learning algorithm is not told what to do with it and it should make the structure itself.\n",
    "    - **Reinforcement**: teaches the machine to think for itself based on past action rewards.\n",
    "- **Test model**: Finally, the testing is done to see if the model is good. The training data was divided into a test set and training set. The test set is used to see if the model can predict from it. If not, a new model might be necessary.\n",
